# Description
The [AVOBMAT](https://avobmat.hu/) (Analysis and Visualization of Bibliographic Metadata and Texts) multilingual research tool enables researchers, without programming skills, to critically analyse bibliographic data and texts at scale. This exploratory tool offers a range of dynamic text and data mining tasks and provides interactive parameter tuning and control from the preprocessing to the analytical stages. The implemented analytical and visualization tools provide close and distant reading of texts and bibliographic data. It helps users realize the epistemological challenges, limitations and strengths of computational text analysis and visual representation of digital texts and datasets. 

**The unique features of the [AVOBMAT](https://avobmat.hu/) toolkit are:**
- it combines bibliographic data and textual analysis, enabling users to ask complex research questions, in one integrated, interactive and user-friendly web application; 
- the use of transformer language models on a scalable, cloud-based infrastructure that allows researchers to preprocess and analyse texts and metadata at scale; 
- it analyses and enriches texts and metadata in 16 languages; 
- users can make their private databases public. 

The workflow of [AVOBMAT](https://avobmat.hu/) was published in the peer-reviewed [Journal of Open Humanities Data](https://openhumanitiesdata.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/johd.175) and the [Social Sciences and Humanities Open Marketplace](https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu/workflow/RzvCOP).

# AVOBMAT features

- **Multilingual Text Enrichment:** [AVOBMAT](https://avobmat.hu/) can preprocess, analyse, and (semantically) enrich a large number of texts and metadata in several languages without coding skills.

- **Interactive Text Analysis:** The analytical and visualization tools provide interactive close and distant reading of texts and bibliographic data.

- **Validated, Transparent and Customizable Workflow:** [AVOBMAT](https://avobmat.hu/) has a transparent, peer-reviewed workflow with customizable parameter settings for all tools.

- **User-friendly NLP tools:** [AVOBMAT](https://avobmat.hu/) combines bibliographic data and natural language processing research methods (e.g. transformer models) in an integrated, interactive and user-friendly web application.

- **Critical Analysis and Visualizations:** [AVOBMAT](https://avobmat.hu/) fosters critical analysis, for instance, by identifying data gaps and missing metadata values.

- **Comparative and Diachronic Analysis:** [AVOBMAT](https://avobmat.hu/) offers multilingual comparative analysis with time-based components.
