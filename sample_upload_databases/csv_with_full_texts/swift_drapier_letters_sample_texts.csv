LETTER, &c.
SIR,
IN your News-Letter of the 1st. Instant there is a Paragraph Dated from London, July 25th. relating to Woods's Half-pence; whereby it is plain what I foretold in my Letter to the Shop-keepers, &c. that this vile Fellow would never be at Rest, and that the Danger of our Ruin approaches nearer, and therefore the Kingdom requires NEW and FRESH WARNING; however I take that Paragraph to be, in a great Measure, an Imposition upon the Publick, at least I hope so, because I am informed that Woods is generally his own News Writer. I cannot but observe from that Paragraph that this Publick Enemy of ours, not satisfied to Ruin us with his Trash, takes every Occasion to treat this Kingdom with the utmost Contempt. He Represents Several of our Merchants and Traders upon Examination before a Committee of a Council, agreeing that there was the utmost Necessity of Copper Money here before his Patent, so that several Gentlemen have been forced to Tally with their Workmen and give them Bits of Cards Sealed and Subscribed with their Names. What then?

If him with a Pound, and mix it up with Poyson? And is not a Landlord's Hand and Seal to his own Labourers a better Security for Five or Ten Shillings, than Woods's Brass Seven Times below the Real Value, can be to the Kingdom, for an Hundred and Four thousand Pounds?
But who are these Merchants and Traders of Ireland that make this Report of the at most Necessity we are under of Copper-Money? They are only a few Betrayers of their Country, Confederates with Woods, from whom they are to purchase a great Quantity of his Coyn, perhaps at half Value, and Vend it among us to the Ruin of the Publick, and their own private Advantage. Are not these excellent Witnesses, upon whose Integrity the Fate of a Kingdom must depend, who are Evidences in their own Cause, and Sharers in this Work of Iniquity?
If we could have deserved the Liberty of Coyning for our selves, as we formerly did, and why we have not is every Body's Wonder as well as mine. Ten thousand Pounds might have been Coyned here in Dublin of only one Fifth below the Intrinsick Value, and this Sum, with the Stock of Half-pence we then had, would have been sufficient: But Wood's by his Emissaries, Enemies to God and this Kingdom, hath taken Care to Buy up as many of our old Half-pence as he could, and from thence the present Want of Change arises; to remove which, by Mr. Woods his Remedy, would be, to Cure a Scratch on the

Finger by Cutting off the Arm. But supposing there were not one Farthing of Change in the whole Nation, I will maintain, that Five and Twenty Thousand Pounds would be a Sum fully sufficient to answer all our Occasions. I am no inconsiderable Shop Keeper in this Town, I have discoursed with several of my own and other Trades, with many Gentlemen both of City and Country, and also with great Numbers of Farmers, Cottagers, and Labourers, who all agree that two Shillings in Change for every Family wou'd be more than necessary in all Dealings. Now by the largest Computation (even before that grievous Discouragement of Agriculture, which hath so much lessened our Numbers) the Souls in this Kingdom are computed to be One Million and a half, which, allowing but Six to a Family, makes Two hundred and Fifty thousand Families, and consequently Two Shillings to each Family will amount only to Five and Twenty thousand Pounds, whereas this Honest Liberal Hard-ware-Man Woods would impose upon us above Four Times that Sum.
Your Paragraph relates further, that Sir Isac Newton Reported an Assay taken at the Tower of Woods's Metal, by which it appears, that Woods had in all Respects performed his Contract. His Contract! With whom? Was it with the Parliament or People of Ireland; Are not they to be the Purchasers? But they Detest, Abhor, and Reject it, as Corrupt Fraudulent, mingled with Dirt and Trash. Upon which he grows Angry, goes to Law and will impose his Goods upon us by Force

But your News-Letter says that an Affair was made of the Coyn. How impudent and insupportable is this? Woods takes Care to Coyn a Dozen or Two Half-pence of good Metal, sends them to the Tower and they are approved, and these must answer all that he hath already Coyned or shall Coyn for the Future. It is true indeed, that a Gentleman often sends to my Shop for a Pattern of Stuff, I cut it fairly off, and if he likes it, he comes or sends and compares the Pattern with the whole Piece, and probably we come to a Bargain. But if I were to Buy an Hundred Sheep, and the Grazier should bring me one single Weather fat and well Fleeced by Way of Pattern, and expect the same Price round for the whole Hundred, without suffering me to see them before he was payed, or giving me good Security to restore my Money for those that were Lean or Shorn or Scabby I would be none of his Customer. I have heard of a Man who had a Mind to Sell his House, and therefore carried a Piece of Brick in his Pocket, which he shewed as a Pattern to encourage Purchasers; And this is directly the Case in Point with Mr. Woods's ASSAY.
The next Part of the Paragraph contains Mr. Woods's voluntary Proposals for preventing any future Objections or Apprehensions.
His first Proposal is, that whereas he hath already Coyned Seventeen thousand Pounds, and has Copper prepared to make it up Fourty thousand Pounds, he will be content to Coyn no more, unless the EXIGENCES OF TRADE REQUIRE IT, though his Patent empowers him to Coyn a far greater Quantity.

To which if I were to Answer it should be thus: Let Mr. Woods and his Crew of Founders and Tinkers Coyn on till there is not an old Kettle left in the Kingdom, let them Coyn old Leather, Tobacco pipe Clay or the Dirt in the Streets, and call their Trumpery by what Name they please from a Guinea to a Farthing we are not under any Concern to know how he and his Tribe or Accomplices think fit to employ themselves. But I hope and trust, that we are all to a Man fully determined to have nothing to do with him or his Ware.
The King has given him a Patent to Coyn Half-pence, but hath not obliged us to take them and I have already shewn in my Letter to the Shop Keepers, &c. that the Law hath not left it in the Power of the Prerogative to compel the Subject to take any Money, beside Gold and Silver of the Right Sterling and Standard.
Woods further proposes, (if I understand him right, for his Expressions are Dubious) that he will not Coyn above Fourty Thousand Pounds, unless THE EXIGENCES OF TRADE REQUIRE IT. First, I observe that this Sum of Fourty Thousand Pounds is almost double to what I proved to be sufficient for the whole Kingdom, although we had not one of our old Half-pence left. Again I ask, who is to be Judge when the EXIGENCES OF TRADE REQUIRE IT? Without Doubt he means himself, for as to us of this poor Kingdom, who must be utterly Ruined if his Project should succeed, we were never Once consulted till the Matter

was over, and he will Judge of our EXIGENCES by his own; neither will these be ever at an End till he and his Accomplices will think they have enough; And it now appears that he will not be content with all our Gold and Silver, but intends to Buy up our Goods and Manufactures with the same Coyn.
I shall not enter into Examination of the Prices for which he now proposes to Sell his Half-pence or what he calls his Copper, by the Pound; I have said enough of it in my former Letter, and it hath likewise been considered by others. It is certain that by his own first Computation, we were to pay Three Shillings for what was intrinsically worth but One, although it had been of the true Weight and Standard for which he pretended to have Contracted; but there is so great a Difference both in Weight and Badness in several of his Coyns that some of them have been Nine in Ten below the Intrinsick Value, and most of them Six or Seven.
His last Proposal being of a peculiar Strain and Nature, deserves to be very particularly consider'd, both on Account of the Matter and the Style. It is as follows.
Lastly, in Consideration of the direful Apprehensions which prevail in Ireland, that Mr. Woods will by such Coynage drain them of their Gold and Silver, be proposes to take their Manufactures in exchange, and that no Person be OBLIGED to receive more than Five pence Half-penny at one payment.
First, Observe this little Impudent Hard-ware Man turning into ridicule the Direful Apprehensions of a whole Kingdom, priding him-

self as the Cause of them, and daring to prescribe what no King of England eyer attempted, how far a whole Nation shall be obliged to take his Brass Coyn. And he has Reason to Insult; for sure there was never an Example in History, of a great Kingdom kept in Awe for above a Year in daily Dread of utter Destruction, not by a powerful Invader at the Head of Twenty thousand Men, not by a Plague or a Famine, not by a Tyrannical Prince (for we never had one more Gracious) or a corrupt Administration, but by one single, diminutive, insignificant, Mechanick.
But to go on. To Remove our DIR EFUL APPREHENSIONS that he will Drain us of our Gold and Silver by his Coinage: This little Arbitrary Mock-Monarch most Graciously offers to take our Manufactures in Exchange. Are our Irish Understandings indeed so low in his Opinion? Is not this the very Misery we complain of? That his cursed Project will put us under the Necessity of Selling our Goods for what is equal to Nothing. How would such a Proposal Sound from France or Spain or any other Country we deal with, if they should offer to deal with us only upon this Condition, that we should take their Money at Ten Times higher than the intrinsick Value? Does Mr. Woods think, for Instance, that we will Sell him a Stone of Wool for a Parcel of his Counters not worth Six-pence, when we can send it to England and receive as many Shillings in Gold and Silver? Surely there was never heard such a Compound of Impudence, Villany and Folly.

His Proposals Conclude with perfect Higo Treason. He promises, that no Person shall be OBLIGED to receive more than Five-pence Half-penny of his Coyn in one Payment; By which it is plain, that he pretends to OBLIGE every Subject in this Kingdom to take so much in every Payment, if it be offered; whereas his Patent Obliges no Man, nor can the Prerogative by Law claim such a Power, as I have often observed; so that here Mr. Woods takes upon him the Entire Legislature, and an absolute Dominion over the Properties of the whole Nation.
Good God! Who are this Wretch's Advisers? Who are his Supporters, Abettors. Encouragers, or Sharers? Mr. Woods will OBLIGE me to take Five pence Half penny of his Brass in every Payment. And I will Shoot Mr. Woods and his Deputies through the Head, like High-way Men or House-breakers, if they dare to force one Farthing of their Coyn up on me in the Payment of an Hundred Pounds. It is no Loss of Honour to submit to the Lyon, but who, with the Figure of a Man, can think with Patience of being Devoured alive by a Rat. He has laid a Tax upon the People of Ireland of Seventeen Shillings at least in the Pound; a Tax I say, not only upon Lands, but Interest-Money, Goods, Manufactures, the Hire of Handicrafts-men, Labourers, and Servants. Shop Keepers look to your selves. Woods will oblige and force you to take Five-pence Halt-penny of his Trash in every Payment, and many of you receive Twenty, Thirty, Fourty Payments in a Day, or else you can hardly find Bread;

And pray consider how much that will amount to in a Year; Twenty Times Five-pence Half-penny is Nine Shillings and Two-pence, which is above an Hundred and Sixty Pounds a Year, whereof you will be Loosers of at least One hundred and Fourty Pounds by taking your Payments in his Money. If any of you be content to Deal with Mr. Woods on such Conditions they may. But for my own Particular. Let his Money perish with him. If the Famous Mr. Hambden rather chose to go to Prison, than pay a few Shillings to King Charles 1st. without Authority of Parliament, I will rather chuse to be Hanged than have all my Substance Taxed at Seventeen Shillings in the Pound, at the Arbitrary Will and Pleasure of the Venerable Mr. Woods.
The Paragraph Concludes thus. N. B. (that is to say Nota bene, or Mark well) No Evidence appeared from Ireland or elsewhere, to prove the Mischiefs complain'd of, or any Abuses whatsoever committed in the Execution of the said Grant.
The Impudence of this Remark exceeds all that went before. First; the House of Commons in Ireland, which Represents the whole People of the Kingdom; and Secondly the Privy Council, Addressed his Majesty against these Half-pence. What could be done more to express the Universal Sense and Opinion of the Nation? If his Copper were Diamonds, and the Kingdom were intirely against it, would not That be sufficient to reject it? Must a Committee of the House of Commons, and our whole Privy Council go over to Argue Pro and Con with Ms, Wood's? To what End did

the King give his Patent for Coyning of Half-pence in Ireland? Was it not, because it was Represented to his Sacred Majesty, that such a Coynage would be of Advantage to the Good of this Kingdom, and of all his Subjects here? It is to the Patentee's Peril if his Representation be false, and the Execution of his Patent be Fraudulent and Corrupt. Is he so Wicked and Foolish to think that his Patent was given him to Ruin a Million and a Half of People that he might be a Gainer of Three or Fourscore Thousand Pounds to himself? Before he was at the Charge of Passing a Patent, much more of Raking up so much Filthy Dross, and Stamping it with his Majesty's Image and Superscription, should he not first in common Sense, in common Equity, and common Manners, have Consulted the principal Party concerned; that is to say, the People of the Kingdom the House of Lords or Commons, or the Privy Council? If any Foreigner should ask us, whose Image and Superscription there is in Woods his Coyn, we should be ashamed to tell him, it was Cesar's. In that great Want of Copper Half-pence, which he alledges we were, Our City set up our Cesar's Statue in Excellent Copper, at an Expence that is Equal in Value to Thirty thousand Pounds of his Coyn: And we will not receive his Image in worse Metal.
I observe many of our People putting a Melancholly Case on this Subject. It is true say they, we are all undone if Wood's Half-pence must pass; but what shall we do, if his Majesty puts out a Proclamation commanding us to take them? This hath been often Dinned in

my Ears. But I desire my Country-men to be assured that there is nothing in it. The King never Issues out a Proclamation but to enjoyn what the Law permits him. He will not Issue out a Proclamation against Law, or is such a thing should happen by a Mistake, we are no more obliged to obey it than to run our Heads into the Fire. Besides, his Majesty will never Command us by Proclamation, what he does not offer to Command us in the Patent it self. There he leaves it to our Discretion, so that our Destruction must be intirely owing to our selves. Therefore let no Man be afraid of a Proclamation, which will never be granted; and if it should, yet upon this Occasion, will be of no Force. The King's Revenues here are near Four hundred Thousand Pounds a Year, can you think his Ministers will Advise him to take them in Woods's Brass, which will reduce the Value to Fifty thousand Pounds. England gets a Million Sterl, by this Nation, which, if this Project goes on will be almost reduc'd to Nothing: And do you think those who Live in England upon Irish Estates will be content to take an Eighth or a Tenth Part, by being paved in Woods's Dross?
If Woods and his Confederates were not convinced of our Stupidity, they never would have attempted so Audacious an Enterprize. He now sees a Spirit hath been raised against him, and he only watches till it begins to Flag, he goes about watching when to Devour us. He hopes we shall be weary of contending with him, and at last out of Ignorance, or Fear, or of being perfectly Tyred with Opposition, we shall be forced to Yield. And therefore I confess it is

my chief Endeavour to keep up your Spirits and Resentments. If I tell you there is a Precipice under you, and that if you go forwards you will certainly break your Necks. If I point to it before your Eyes, must I be at the Trouble of repeating it every Morning? Are our Peoples hearts waxed Gross? Are their Ears Dull of hearing, and have they cloased their Eyes? I fear there are some few Vipers among us, who for Ten or Twenty Pounds Gain, would sell their Souls and their Country, though at last it would end in their own Ruin as well as Ours. Be not like the Deaf Adder, who refuses to hear the Voice of the Charmer, charm he never so wisely.
Though my Letter be Directed to you, Mr. Harding, yet I intend it for all my Countrymen I have no Interest in this affair but what is common to the Publick, I can live better than many others, I have some Gold and Silver by me, and a Shop well furnished, and shall be able to make a Shife when many of my Betters are Starving. But I am grieved to see the Coldness and Indifference of many People, with whom I discourse. Some are afraid of a Proclamation, Others Shrug up their Shoulders, and cry, what would you have us do? Some give out, there is no Danger at all. Others are comforted that it will be a common Calamity and they shall fare no worse than their Neighbours. Will a Man, who hears Midnight-Robbers at his Door, get out of Bed, and raise his Familie for a common Defence, and shall a whole Kingdom lye in a Lethargy, while Mr. Woods comes at the Head of his Confederates to Rob them of all they have to Ruin us and our Posterity for ever? If an High-way-man

meets you on the Road, you give him your Money to save your Life, but. God be thanked, Mr. Woods cannot touch a Hair of your Heads. You have all the Laws of God and Man on your side. When he or his Accomplices offer you his Dross, it is but saying No, and you are Safe. If a Mad-man should come to my Shop with an Handful of Dirt raked out of the Kennel, and offer it in payment for Ten Yards of Stuff, I would Pity or Laugh at him, or, if his Behaviour deserved it, Kick him out of my Doors. And if Mr. Woods comes to demand any Gold or Silver, or Comodities for which I have payed my Gold and Silver, in Exchange for his Trash, can he deserve or expect better Treatment?
When the Evil Day is come (if it must come) let us mark and observe those who presume to offer these Half-pence in Payment. Let their Names, and Trades, and Places of Aboad be made Publick, that every one may be aware of them, as Betrayers of their Country, and Confederates with Mr. Woods. Let them be watched at Markets and Fairs, and let the first honest Discoverer give the Word about, that Woods's Half pence have been offered, and caution the poor innocent People not to receive them.
Perhaps I have been too Tedious; but there would never be an End, if I attempted to say all that this melancholly Subject will bear. I will Conclude with humbly offering one Proposal, which, if it were put in Practice, would low up this Destructive Project at once. Let me Skilful Judicious Pen draw up an ADVERTISEMENT to the following Purse. That

Whereas one William Woods Hard-ware-Man, now or lately Sojourning in the City of London, hath, by many Misrepresentations, procured a Patent for Coyning an Hundred and Fourty thousand Pounds in Copper Half-pence for this Kingdom, which is a Sum Five Times greater than our Occasions require. And whereas it is Notorious that the said Woods hath Coyned his Half-pence of such base Metal and false Weight, that they are, at least, Six Parts in Seven below the real Value. And whereas we have Reason to apprehend, that the said Woods may, at any Time hereafter, clandestinely Coyn as many more Half pence as he pleases. And whereas the said Patent neither doth nor can Oblige his Majesty's Subjects to receive the said Half-pence in any Payment, but leaves it to their Voluntary Choice, because, by Law the Subject cannot be Obliged to take any Money except Gold or Silver. And whereas contrary to the Letter and Meaning of the said Patent, the said Woods hath Declared that every Person shall be OBLIGED to take Five-pence Half-penny of his Coyn in every Payment. And whereas the House of Commons and Privy-Council have severally Addressed his Most Sacred Majesty, Representing the ill Consequences which the said Coinage may have upon this Kingdom. And lastly whereas it is universally agreed, that the whole Nation to a Man (except Mr. Woods and his Confederates) are in the utmost Apprehensions of the Ruinous Consequences, that must follow from the said Coinage. Therefore we whose Names are under written being Persons of considerable Estates in this Kingdom, and Residers therein, do unanimously Resolve and De-

clare that we will never receive, one Farthing or Halt-penny of the said Woods's Coyning, and that we will direct all our Tenants to refuse the said Coyn from any Person whatsoever; Of which that they may not be Ignorant, we have sent them a Copy of this Advertisement, to be Read to them by our Stewards, Receivers, &c.
I could wish, that a Paper of this Nature might be Drawn up, and Signed by Two or Three Hundred principal Gentlemen of this Kingdom, and Printed Copies thereof sent to their several Tenants; I am deceived, if any thing could sooner defeat this Execrable Design of Woods and his Accomplices. This would immediately give the Alarm, and set the Kingdom on their Guard. This would give Courage to the meanest Tenant and Cottager. How long, O Lord, Righteous and True
I must tell you in Particular, Mr. Harding, that you are much to blame. Several Hundred Persons have enquired at your House for my Letter to the Shop-Keepers, &c. and you had none to Sell them. Pray keep your self provided with that Letter and with this; you have got very well by the former, but I did not then Write for your Sake, any more than I do now. Pray Advertise both in every NewsPaper, and let it not be YOUR Fault or MINE, if our Country-Men will not take Warning. I desire you likewise to Sell them as Cheap as you can.
I am your Servant,
Aug. 4. 1724."

SIR,
IN your News-Letter of the 1st.

I cannot but observe from that Paragraph that this Publick Enemy of ours, not satisfied to Ruin us with his Trash, takes every Occasion to treat this Kingdom with the utmost Contempt. He Represents Several of our Merchants and Traders upon Examination before a Committee of a Council, agreeing that there was the utmost Necessity of Copper Money here before his Patent, so that several Gentlemen have been forced to Tally with their Workmen and give them Bits of Cards Sealed and Subscribed with their Names. What then?

The next Part of the Paragraph contains Mr. Woods's voluntary Proposals for preventing any future Objections or Apprehensions.
His first Proposal is, that whereas he hath already Coyned Seventeen thousand Pounds, and has Copper prepared to make it up Fourty thousand Pounds, he will be content to Coyn no more, unless the EXIGENCES OF TRADE REQUIRE IT, though his Patent empowers him to Coyn a far greater Quantity.

To which if I were to Answer it should be thus: Let Mr. Woods and his Crew of Founders and Tinkers Coyn on till there is not an old Kettle left in the Kingdom, let them Coyn old Leather, Tobacco pipe Clay or the Dirt in the Streets, and call their Trumpery by what Name they please from a Guinea to a Farthing we are not under any Concern to know how he and his Tribe or Accomplices think fit to employ themselves.

First, I observe that this Sum of Fourty Thousand Pounds is almost double to what I proved to be sufficient for the whole Kingdom, although we had not one of our old Half-pence left.

I shall not enter into Examination of the Prices for which he now proposes to Sell his Half-pence or what he calls his Copper, by the Pound; I have said enough of it in my former Letter, and it hath likewise been considered by others. It is certain that by his own first Computation, we were to pay Three Shillings for what was intrinsically worth but One, although it had been of the true Weight and Standard for which he pretended to have Contracted; but there is so great a Difference both in Weight and Badness in several of his Coyns that some of them have been Nine in Ten below the Intrinsick Value, and most of them Six or Seven.

But to go on. To Remove our DIR EFUL APPREHENSIONS that he will Drain us of our Gold and Silver by his Coinage: This little Arbitrary Mock-Monarch most Graciously offers to take our Manufactures in Exchange. Are our Irish Understandings indeed so low in his Opinion? Is not this the very Misery we complain of? That his cursed Project will put us under the Necessity of Selling our Goods for what is equal to Nothing. How would such a Proposal Sound from France or Spain or any other Country we deal with, if they should offer to deal with us only upon this Condition, that we should take their Money at Ten Times higher than the intrinsick Value? Does Mr. Woods think, for Instance, that we will Sell him a Stone of Wool for a Parcel of his Counters not worth Six-pence, when we can send it to England and receive as many Shillings in Gold and Silver?

Good God! Who are this Wretch's Advisers? Who are his Supporters, Abettors. Encouragers, or Sharers? Mr. Woods will OBLIGE me to take Five pence Half penny of his Brass in every Payment. And I will Shoot Mr. Woods and his Deputies through the Head, like High-way Men or House-breakers, if they dare to force one Farthing of their Coyn up on me in the Payment of an Hundred Pounds. It is no Loss of Honour to submit to the Lyon, but who, with the Figure of a Man, can think with Patience of being Devoured alive by a Rat. He has laid a Tax upon the People of Ireland of Seventeen Shillings at least in the Pound; a Tax I say, not only upon Lands, but Interest-Money, Goods, Manufactures, the Hire of Handicrafts-men, Labourers, and Servants. Shop Keepers look to your selves. Woods will oblige and force you to take Five-pence Halt-penny of his Trash in every Payment, and many of you receive Twenty, Thirty, Fourty Payments in a Day, or else you can hardly find Bread;

And pray consider how much that will amount to in a Year; Twenty Times Five-pence Half-penny is Nine Shillings and Two-pence, which is above an Hundred and Sixty Pounds a Year, whereof you will be Loosers of at least One hundred and Fourty Pounds by taking your Payments in his Money. If any of you be content to Deal with Mr. Woods on such Conditions they may. But for my own Particular. Let his Money perish with him. If the Famous Mr. Hambden rather chose to go to Prison, than pay a few Shillings to King Charles 1st. without Authority of Parliament, I will rather chuse to be Hanged than have all my Substance Taxed at Seventeen Shillings in the Pound, at the Arbitrary Will and Pleasure of the Venerable Mr. Woods.
The Paragraph Concludes thus. N. B. (that is to say Nota bene, or Mark well) No Evidence appeared from Ireland or elsewhere, to prove the Mischiefs complain'd of, or any Abuses whatsoever committed in the Execution of the said Grant.
The Impudence of this Remark exceeds all that went before. First; the House of Commons in Ireland, which Represents the whole People of the Kingdom; and Secondly the Privy Council, Addressed his Majesty against these Half-pence. What could be done more to express the Universal Sense and Opinion of the Nation? If his Copper were Diamonds, and the Kingdom were intirely against it, would not That be sufficient to reject it? Must a Committee of the House of Commons, and our whole Privy Council go over to Argue Pro and Con with Ms, Wood's? To what End did

the King give his Patent for Coyning of Half-pence in Ireland? Was it not, because it was Represented to his Sacred Majesty, that such a Coynage would be of Advantage to the Good of this Kingdom, and of all his Subjects here? It is to the Patentee's Peril if his Representation be false, and the Execution of his Patent be Fraudulent and Corrupt. Is he so Wicked and Foolish to think that his Patent was given him to Ruin a Million and a Half of People that he might be a Gainer of Three or Fourscore Thousand Pounds to himself? Before he was at the Charge of Passing a Patent, much more of Raking up so much Filthy Dross, and Stamping it with his Majesty's Image and Superscription, should he not first in common Sense, in common Equity, and common Manners, have Consulted the principal Party concerned; that is to say, the People of the Kingdom the House of Lords or Commons, or the Privy Council? If any Foreigner should ask us, whose Image and Superscription there is in Woods his Coyn, we should be ashamed to tell him, it was Cesar's. In that great Want of Copper Half-pence, which he alledges we were, Our City set up our Cesar's Statue in Excellent Copper, at an Expence that is Equal in Value to Thirty thousand Pounds of his Coyn: And we will not receive his Image in worse Metal.
I observe many of our People putting a Melancholly Case on this Subject. It is true say they, we are all undone if Wood's Half-pence must pass; but what shall we do, if his Majesty puts out a Proclamation commanding us to take them? This hath been often Dinned in

my Ears. But I desire my Country-men to be assured that there is nothing in it. The King never Issues out a Proclamation but to enjoyn what the Law permits him. He will not Issue out a Proclamation against Law, or is such a thing should happen by a Mistake, we are no more obliged to obey it than to run our Heads into the Fire. Besides, his Majesty will never Command us by Proclamation, what he does not offer to Command us in the Patent it self. There he leaves it to our Discretion, so that our Destruction must be intirely owing to our selves. Therefore let no Man be afraid of a Proclamation, which will never be granted; and if it should, yet upon this Occasion, will be of no Force. The King's Revenues here are near Four hundred Thousand Pounds a Year, can you think his Ministers will Advise him to take them in Woods's Brass, which will reduce the Value to Fifty thousand Pounds. England gets a Million Sterl, by this Nation, which, if this Project goes on will be almost reduc'd to Nothing: And do you think those who Live in England upon Irish Estates will be content to take an Eighth or a Tenth Part, by being paved in Woods's Dross?
If Woods and his Confederates were not convinced of our Stupidity, they never would have attempted so Audacious an Enterprize. He now sees a Spirit hath been raised against him, and he only watches till it begins to Flag, he goes about watching when to Devour us. He hopes we shall be weary of contending with him, and at last out of Ignorance, or Fear, or of being perfectly Tyred with Opposition, we shall be forced to Yield. And therefore I confess it is

my chief Endeavour to keep up your Spirits and Resentments. If I tell you there is a Precipice under you, and that if you go forwards you will certainly break your Necks. If I point to it before your Eyes, must I be at the Trouble of repeating it every Morning? Are our Peoples hearts waxed Gross? Are their Ears Dull of hearing, and have they cloased their Eyes? I fear there are some few Vipers among us, who for Ten or Twenty Pounds Gain, would sell their Souls and their Country, though at last it would end in their own Ruin as well as Ours. Be not like the Deaf Adder, who refuses to hear the Voice of the Charmer, charm he never so wisely.
Though my Letter be Directed to you, Mr. Harding, yet I intend it for all my Countrymen I have no Interest in this affair but what is common to the Publick, I can live better than many others, I have some Gold and Silver by me, and a Shop well furnished, and shall be able to make a Shife when many of my Betters are Starving. But I am grieved to see the Coldness and Indifference of many People, with whom I discourse. Some are afraid of a Proclamation, Others Shrug up their Shoulders, and cry, what would you have us do? Some give out, there is no Danger at all. Others are comforted that it will be a common Calamity and they shall fare no worse than their Neighbours. Will a Man, who hears Midnight-Robbers at his Door, get out of Bed, and raise his Familie for a common Defence, and shall a whole Kingdom lye in a Lethargy, while Mr. Woods comes at the Head of his Confederates to Rob them of all they have to Ruin us and our Posterity for ever? If an High-way-man

meets you on the Road, you give him your Money to save your Life, but. God be thanked, Mr. Woods cannot touch a Hair of your Heads. You have all the Laws of God and Man on your side. When he or his Accomplices offer you his Dross, it is but saying No, and you are Safe. If a Mad-man should come to my Shop with an Handful of Dirt raked out of the Kennel, and offer it in payment for Ten Yards of Stuff, I would Pity or Laugh at him, or, if his Behaviour deserved it, Kick him out of my Doors. And if Mr. Woods comes to demand any Gold or Silver, or Comodities for which I have payed my Gold and Silver, in Exchange for his Trash, can he deserve or expect better Treatment?
When the Evil Day is come (if it must come) let us mark and observe those who presume to offer these Half-pence in Payment. Let their Names, and Trades, and Places of Aboad be made Publick, that every one may be aware of them, as Betrayers of their Country, and Confederates with Mr. Woods. Let them be watched at Markets and Fairs, and let the first honest Discoverer give the Word about, that Woods's Half pence have been offered, and caution the poor innocent People not to receive them.
Perhaps I have been too Tedious; but there would never be an End, if I attempted to say all that this melancholly Subject will bear. I will Conclude with humbly offering one Proposal, which, if it were put in Practice, would low up this Destructive Project at once. Let me Skilful Judicious Pen draw up an ADVERTISEMENT to the following Purse. That

Whereas one William Woods Hard-ware-Man, now or lately Sojourning in the City of London, hath, by many Misrepresentations, procured a Patent for Coyning an Hundred and Fourty thousand Pounds in Copper Half-pence for this Kingdom, which is a Sum Five Times greater than our Occasions require. And whereas it is Notorious that the said Woods hath Coyned his Half-pence of such base Metal and false Weight, that they are, at least, Six Parts in Seven below the real Value. And whereas we have Reason to apprehend, that the said Woods may, at any Time hereafter, clandestinely Coyn as many more Half pence as he pleases. And whereas the said Patent neither doth nor can Oblige his Majesty's Subjects to receive the said Half-pence in any Payment, but leaves it to their Voluntary Choice, because, by Law the Subject cannot be Obliged to take any Money except Gold or Silver. And whereas contrary to the Letter and Meaning of the said Patent, the said Woods hath Declared that every Person shall be OBLIGED to take Five-pence Half-penny of his Coyn in every Payment. And whereas the House of Commons and Privy-Council have severally Addressed his Most Sacred Majesty, Representing the ill Consequences which the said Coinage may have upon this Kingdom. And lastly whereas it is universally agreed, that the whole Nation to a Man (except Mr. Woods and his Confederates) are in the utmost Apprehensions of the Ruinous Consequences, that must follow from the said Coinage. Therefore we whose Names are under written being Persons of considerable Estates in this Kingdom, and Residers therein, do unanimously Resolve and De-

clare that we will never receive, one Farthing or Halt-penny of the said Woods's Coyning, and that we will direct all our Tenants to refuse the said Coyn from any Person whatsoever; Of which that they may not be Ignorant, we have sent them a Copy of this Advertisement, to be Read to them by our Stewards, Receivers, &c.
I could wish, that a Paper of this Nature might be Drawn up, and Signed by Two or Three Hundred principal Gentlemen of this Kingdom, and Printed Copies thereof sent to their several Tenants; I am deceived, if any thing could sooner defeat this Execrable Design of Woods and his Accomplices. This would immediately give the Alarm, and set the Kingdom on their Guard. This would give Courage to the meanest Tenant and Cottager. How long, O Lord, Righteous and True
I must tell you in Particular, Mr. Harding, that you are much to blame. Several Hundred Persons have enquired at your House for my Letter to the Shop-Keepers, &c. and you had none to Sell them. Pray keep your self provided with that Letter and with this; you have got very well by the former, but I did not then Write for your Sake, any more than I do now. Pray Advertise both in every NewsPaper, and let it not be YOUR Fault or MINE, if our Country-Men will not take Warning. I desire you likewise to Sell them as Cheap as you can.
I am your Servant,
Aug. 4. 1724."

Mr. Harding,
WHen I sent you my former Papers, I cannot say I intended you either Good or Hurt, and yet you have happened through my Means to receive Both. I pray God deliver you from any more of the Latter, and increase the Former. Your Trade, particularly in this Kingdom, is of all others the most unfortunately Circumstantiated; For as you deal in the most worthless kind of Trash, the Penny Productions of Pennyless Scriblers, so you often venture your Liberty and sometimes your Lives, for the

Purchase of Half a Crown, and by your own Ignorance are punished for other Mens Actions.
I am afraid, You in particular think you have Reason to complain of Me for your own and your Wife's Confinement in PRISON, to your great Expence, as well as Hardship, and for a Prosecution still impending. But I will tell you, Mr. Harding, how that Matter stands. Since the Press hath layn under so strict an Inspection, those who have a mind to inform the World are become so Cautious, as to keep themselves if possible out of the Way of Danger. My Custom is to Dictate to a 'Prentice who can write in a Feigned Hand, and what is written we send to your House by a Black-guard Boy. But at the same time I do assure you upon

my Reputation, that I never did send you any thing, for which I thought you could possibly be called to an Account. And you will be my Witness that I always desired you by a Letter to take some good Advice before you ventured to Print, because I knew the Dexterity of Dealers in the Law at finding out something to Fasten on where no Evil is meant; I am told indeed, that you did accordingly consult several very able Persons, and even Some who afterwards appeared against you: To which I can only answer, that you must either change your Advisers, or determine to Print nothing that comes from a Drapier.
I desire you will send the inclosed Letter, directed to my Lord Viscount Molesworth at his House at Brackdenstown near Swords; but

I would have it sent Printed for the Convenience of His Lordship's Reading, because this Counterfeit Hand of my 'Prentice is not very legible. And if you think fit to Publish it, I would have you first get it Read over carefully by some Notable Lawyer: I am assured you will find enough of them who are Friends to the Drapier, and will do it without a Fee, which I am afraid you can ill afford after all your Expences. For although I have taken so much Care, that I think it impossible to find a Topick out of the following Papers for sending you again to Prison; Yet I will not venture to be your Guarantee.
This ensuing Letter contains only a short Account of my self, and an Humble Apology for my former Pamphlets, especially the

Last, with little Mention of Mr. Wood or his Half-pence, because I have already said enough upon that Subject, until Occasion shall be given for New Fears; and in that Case you may perhaps hear from me again.
I am, Your Friend and Servant, M. B. From my Shop in St. Francis-street Dec. 14. 1724.
P. S. For want of Intercourse between You and Me, which I never will suffer, your People are apt to make very gross Errors in the Press, which I desire you will provide against.

To the Right Ho-
nourable the Lord Viscount Moles-
worth, at his House at Brackdenstown near Swords.
My LORD,
IReflect too late on the Maxim of common Observers, that those who meddle in Matters out of their Calling, will have Reason to repent; which is now verified in me: For by engaging in the Trade of a Writer, I have drawn upon my self the Displeasure of the Government, signified by a Proclamation promising a Reward of Three Hundred Pounds to the first faithful Subject who shall be able and inclined to inform against me. To which I may add the laudable Zeal and Industry of my Lord Chief Justice in his Endeavours to discover so Dangerous a Person. Therefore whether I repent or no, I have certainly Cause to do so, and the common Observation still stands good.
It will sometimes happen, I know not how in the Course of Human Affairs, that a Man shall be made lyable to Legal Animadversions,

where he has nothing to answer for, either to God or his Country; and condemned at Westminster Hall for what he will never be charged with at the Day of Judgment.
After strictly examining my own Heart and consulting some Divines of great Reputation, I cannot accuse my self of any Malice or Wickedness against the Publick; of any Designs to Sow Sedition, of reflecting on the King and his Ministers, or of endeavouring to alienate the Affections of the People of this Kingdom from those of England. All I can charge my self with, is a weak Attempt to serve a Nation in Danger of Destruction by a most wicked and malicious Projector, without waiting until I were called to its Assistance; which Attempt, however it may perhaps give me the Title of Pragmatical and Overweening, will never lye a Burthen upon my Conscience. God knows whether I may not with all my caution have already run my self into Danger, by offering thus much in my own Vindication. For I have heard of a Judge, who, upon the Criminal's Appeal to the Dreadful Day of Judgment, told him he had incurred a Premunire for appealing to a Foreign Jurisdiction: And of another in Wales, who serverely checked the Prisoner for offering the same Plea, taxing him with reflecting on the Court by such a Comparison, because Comparisons were odious.
But in Order to make some Excuse for being more speculative than others of my Condition, I desire your Lordship's Pardon, while I am doing a very foolish thing, which is, to give you some little Account of my self.

I was bred at a Free-School where I acquired some little Knowledge in the Latin Tongue, I served my Apprenticeship in London, and there set up for my self with good Success, till by the Death of some Friends, and the Misfortunes of Others, I returned into this Kingdom, and began to employ my Thoughts in cultivating the Woollen Manufacture through all it's Branches. Wherein I met with great Discouragement and Powerful Opposers, whose Objections appeared to me very strange and singular. They argued that the People of England would be offended if our Manufactures were brought to equal theirs; and even some of the Weaving Trade were my Enemies, which I could not but look upon as absurd and unnatural. I remember your Lordship at that time did me the Honour to come into my Shop, where I shewed you a Piece of Black and White Stuff just sent from the Dyer, which you were pleased to approve of, and be my Customer for it.
However I was so mortified, that I resolved for the future to sit quietly in my Shop, and Deal in Common Goods like the rest of my Brethren. Till it happened some Months ago considering with my self that the lower and poorer Sort of People wanted a plain strong course Stuff to defend them against cold Easterly Winds, which then blew very fierce and blasting for a long time together. I contrived one on purpose, which sold very well all over the Kingdom, and preserved many Thousands from Agues. I then made a Second and a Third kind of Stuffs for the Gentry with the same

Success, insomuch that an Ague hath hardly been heard of for some time.
This incited me so far, that I ventured upon a Fourth Piece made of the best Irish Wooll I could get, and I thought it Grave and Rich enough to be worn by the best Lord or Judge of the Land. But of late some Great Folks complain as I hear, that when they had it on, they felt a Shuddering in their Limbs, and have thrown it off in a Rage, cursing to Hell the poor Drapier who invented it, so that I am determined never to work for Persons of Quality again, except for your Lordship and a very few more.
I assure your Lordship upon the Word of an Honest Citizen, that I am not Richer by the Value of one of Mr. Wood's Half-pence with the Sale of all the several Stuffs I have contrived; for I give the whole Profit to the Dyers and Pressers. And therefore I hope you will please to believe, that no other Motive beside the Love of my Country could engage me to busie my Head and Hands to the Loss of my Time and the Gain of nothing but Vexation and Ill Will.
I have now in Hand one Piece of Stuff to be woven on purpose for your Lordship, although I might be ashamed to offer it you, after I have confessed that it will be made only from the Shreds and Remnants of the Wooll employed in the Former. However I shall work it up as well as I can, and at worst, you need only give it among your Tenants.
I am very sensible how ill your Lordship is like to be entertained with the Pedantry of

a Drapier in the Terms of his own Trade. How will the Matter be mended, when you find me entring again, though very sparingly, into an Affair of State; For such is now grown the Controversie with Mr. Wood, if some great Lawyers are to be Credited. And as it often happens at Play, that Men begin with Farthings, and go on to Gold, till some of them lose their Estates and dye in Jayl; so it may possibly fall out in my Case, that by playing too long with Mr. Wood's Half-pence, I may be drawn in to pay a Fine, double to the Reward for Betraying me, be sent to Prison, and not be delivered thence 'till I shall have payed the uttermost Farthing.
There are my Lord, three sorts of Persons with whom I am resolved never to dispute; A High-way-man with a Pistol at my Breast, a Troop of Dragoons who come to plunder my House, and a Man of the Law who can make a Merit of accusing Me. In each of these Cases, which are almost the same, the best Method is to keep out of the Way, and the next Best is to deliver your Money, surrender your House, and confess nothing.
I am told that the two Points in my last Letter, from which an Occasion of Offence hath been taken, are where I mention his Majesty's Answer to the Address of the House of Lords upon Mr. Wood's Patent, and where I discourse upon Ireland's being a Dependent Kingdom. As to the Former, I can only say, that I have treated it with the utmost Respect and Caution, and I thought it necessary to shew where Wood's Patent differed in many

essential Parts from all others that ever had been Granted, because the contrary had for want of due Information been so strongly and so largely asserted. As to the other, of Ireland's Dependency, I confess to have often heard it mentioned, but was never able to understand what it meant. This gave me the Curiosity to enquire among several Eminent Lawyers, who professed they knew nothing of the Matter. I then turned over all the Statutes of both Kingdoms without the least Information, further than an Irish Act that I quoted of the 33d, of Henry 8th, uniting Ireland to England under one King. I cannot say I was sorry to be disappointed in my Search, because it is certain, I could be contented to depend only upon God and my Prince and the Laws of my own Country, after the Manner of other Nations. But since my Betters are of a Different Opinion, and desire further Dependencies, I shall readily submit, not insisting on the Exception I made of M. B. Drapier. For indeed that Hint was borrowed from an Idle Story I had heard in England, which perhaps may be common and beaten, but because it insinuates neither Treason nor Sedition, I will just barely relate it.
Some Hundred Years ago when the Peers were so great that the Commons were looked upon as little better than their Dependents. A Bill was brought in for making some new Additions to the Power and Privileges of the Peerage. After it was read, one Mr. Drue a Member of the House, stood up, and said, he very much approved the Bill, and would

give his Vote to have it Pass; but however, for some Reasons best known to himself, he desired that a Clause might be inserted for excepting the Family of the Drues. The Odness of the Proposition taught others to reflect a little, and the Bill was thrown out.
Whether I were mistaken, or WENT TOO FAR in examining the Dependency must be left to the impartial Judgment of the World, as well as to the Courts of Judicature, although indeed not in so effectual and decisive a Manner. But to affirm, as I hear some do, in order to countenance a fearful and servile Spirit, that this Point did not belong to my Subject, is a False and Foolish Objection. There were several Scandalous Reports industriously spread by Wood and his Accomplices to discourage all Opposition against his Infamous Project. They gave it out that we were prepared for a Rebellion, that we disputed the King's Prerogative, and were shaking off our Dependency. The first went so far, and obtained so much Belief against the most visible Demonstrations to the contrary, that a great Person of this Kingdom, now in England, sent over such an Account of it to his Friends, as would make any good Subject both grieve and tremble, I thought it therefore necessary to treat that Calumny as it deserved. Then I proved by an invincible Argument that we could have no Intention to dispute his Majesty's Prerogative, because the Prerogative was not concerned in the Question, the Civilians and Lawyers of all Nations agreeing that Copper is not Money.

And lastly to clear us from the Imputation of shaking off our Dependency; I shewed wherein as I thought this Dependency consisted, and Cited the Statute abovementioned made in Ireland, by which it is enacted, that whoever is King of England shall be King of Ireland, and that the Two Kingdoms shall be for ever knit together under one King. This, as I conceived, did wholly acquit us of Intending to break our Dependency, because it was altogether out of our Power, for surely no King of England will ever consent to the Repeal of that Statute.
But upon this Article I am charged with a heavier Accusation. It is said I WENT TOO FAR, when I declared, that if ever the Pretender should come to be fixed upon the Throne of England (which God forbid) I would so far venture to transgress this Statute, that I would lose the last Drop of my Blood before I would submit to him as King of Ireland.
This I hear on all Sides, is the strongest and weightiest Objection against me and which hath given the most Offence; that I should be so bold to declare against a direct Statute, and that any Motive how strong so ever, could make me reject a King whom England should receive. Now if in defending my self from this Accusation I should freely confess, that I WENT TOO FAR, that the Expression was very indiscreet, although occasioned by my Zeal for his present Majesty and his Protestant Line in the House of Hanover, That I shall be careful never to offend again in the like Kind. And that I

hope this free Acknowledgment and Sorrow for my Error, will be some Attonement and a little soften the Hearts of my Powerful Adversaries. I say if I should offer such a Defence as this, I do not doubt but some People would wrest it to an ill Meaning by some spiteful Interpretation, and therefore since I cannot think of any other Answer, which that Paragraph can admit, I will leave it to the Mercy of every Candid Reader.
I will now venture to tell your Lordship a Secret, wherein I fear you are too deeply concerned. You will therefore please to know that this Habit of Writing and Discoursing, wherein I unfortunately differ from almost the whole Kingdom, and am apt to Grate the Ears of more than I could wish was acquired during my Apprenticeship in London, and a long Residence there after I had set up for my self. Upon my Return and Settlement here, I thought I had only changed one Country of Freedom for another. I had been long conversing with the Writings of your Lordship, Mr. Lock, Mr. Molineaux, Collonel Sidney and other Dangerous Authors, who talk of Liberty as a Blessing, to which the whole Race of Mankind hath an original Title, whereof nothing but unlawful Force can divest them. I knew a good deal of the several Gothick Institutions in Europe, and by what Incidents and Events they came to be destroyed; and I ever thought it the most uncontrolled and universally agreed Maxim, that Freedom con-

sists in a People being Governed by Laws made with their own Consent, and Slavery in the Contrary. I have been likewise told, and believe it to be true, that Liberty and Property are Words of known Use and Signification in this Kingdom, and that the very Lawyers pretend to understand, and have them often in their Mouths. These were the Errors which have missed me, and to which alone I must impute the severe Treatment I have received. But I shall in Time grow Wiser, and learn to consider my Driver, the Road I am in, and with whom I am Yoked. This I will venture to say, that the boldest and most obnoxious Words I ever delivered, would in England have only exposed me as a stupid Fool, who went to prove that the Sun shone in a Clear Summers Day; and I have Witnesses ready to depose that your Lordship hath said and writ Fifty times worse, and what is still an Aggravation, with infinitely more Wit and Learning, and stronger Arguments, so that as Politicks run, I do not know a Person of more exceptionable Principles than Yourself; and if ever I shall be discovered, I think you will be bound in Honour to pay my Fine and support me in Prison; or else I may chance to Inform against you by Way of Reprisal.
In the mean time, I beg your Lordship to receive my Confession, that if there be any such thing as a Dependency of Ireland upon England, otherwise than as I have explained

it, either by the Law of God, of Nature, of Reason, of Nations, or of the Land (which I shall never hereafter contest,) then was the Proclamation against me, the most Merciful that ever was put out, and instead of accusing me as Malicious, Wicked and Seditious, it might have been directly as Guilty of High Treason.
All I desire is, that the Cause of my Country against Mr. Wood may not suffer by any Inadvertancy of mine; Whether Ireland depend upon England, or only upon God, the King and the Law, I hope no Man will assert that it depends upon Mr. Wood. I should be heartily sorry that this Commendable Resentment against me should accidentally (and I hope, what was never intended) strike a Damp upon that Spirit in all Ranks and Corporations of Men against the desperate and Ruinous Design of Mr. Wood. Let my Countrymen blot out those Parts in my last Letter which they dislike, and let no Rust remain on my Sword to cure the Wounds I have given to our most Mortal Enemy. When Sir Charles Sidney was taking the Oaths, where several Things were to be Renounced, he said he loved Renouncing, asked if any more were to be Renounced, for he was ready to Renounce as much as they pleased. Although I am not so thorough a Renouncer; yet let me have but Good City Security against this Pestilent Coynage, and I shall be ready not only to Renounce every Syllable in all my Four Letters,

but deliver them chearfully with my own Hands into those of the Common Hang-Man, to be burnt with no better Company than the Coyner's Effigies, if any Part of it hath escaped out of the Secular Hands of the Rabble.
But whatever the Sentiments of some People may be, I think it is agreed that many of those who Subscribed against me, are on the Side of a vast Majority in the Kingdom who opposed Mr. Wood; and it was with great Satisfaction that I observed some Right Honourable Names very amicably joined with my own at the Bottom of a strong Declaration against Him and his Coyn. But if the Admission of it among us be already determined the Worthy Person who is to Betray me ought in Prudence to do it with all convenient Speed, or else it may be difficult to find Three hundred Pounds in Sterling for the Discharge of his Hire; when the Publick shall have lost Five hundred Thousand, if there be so much in the Nation, besides Four Fifths of its Annual Income for ever.
I am told by Lawyers that in all Quarrels between Man and Man, it is of much Weight, which of them gave the first Provocation or struck the first Blow. It is manifest that Mr. Wood hath done Both, and therefore I should humbly propose to have him first Hanged and his Dross thrown into the Sea; after which the Drapier will be ready to stand his Tryal. It must needs be

that Offences come, but Wo unto him by whom the Offence cometh. If Mr. Wood had held his Hand every body else would have held their Tongues, and then there would have been little Need of Pamphlets, Juries, or Proclamations upon this Occasion. The Provocation must needs have been Great, which could stir up an obscure indolent Drapier to become an Author. One would almost think the very Stones in the Street would Rise up in such a Cause: And I am not sure they will not do so against Mr. Wood if ever he comes within their Reach. It is a known Story of the Dumb Boy, whose Tongue forced a Passage for Speech by the Horrour of seeing a Dagger at his Father's Throat. This may lessen the Wonder that a Tradesman hid in Privacy and Silence should cry out when the Life and Being of his Political Mother are attempted before his Face, and by so infamous a Hand.
But in the mean time, Mr. Wood the Destroyer of a Kingdom walks about in Triumph (unless it be true that he is in Jayl for Debt) while he who endeavoured to assert the Liberty of his Country is forced to hide his Head for occasionally dealing in a Matter of Controversy. However I am not the first who hath been condemned to Death for gaining a great Victory over a Powerful Enemy, by disobeying for once the strict Orders of Military Discipline.

I am now resolved to follow (after the usual Proceeding of Mankind, because it is too late) the Advice given me by a certain Dean. He shewed the Mistake I was in on trusting to the general Good Will of the People, that I had succeeded hither to better than could be expected, but that some Unfortunate Circumstantial Lapse would probably bring me within the Reach of Power. That my good Intentions would be no Security against those who watched every Motion of my Pen, in the Bitterness of my Soul. He produced an Instance of a Writer as Innocent, as disinterested, and as well meaning as my self, where the Printer, who had the Author in his Power, was prosecuted with the utmost Zeal, the Jury sent back Nine Times, and the Man given up to the Mercy of the Court. The Dean further observed that I was in a manner left alone to stand the Battle, while others who had ten Thousand times better Talents than a Drapier, were so prudent to lye still, and perhaps thought it no unpleasant Amusement to look on with Safety, while another was giving them Diversion at the Hazard of his Liberty and Fortune, and thought they made a sufficient Recompence by a little Applause, whereupon he concluded with a short Story of a Jew at Madrid, who being condemned to the Fire on Account of his Religion, a Crowd of School-boys following him to the Stake, and apprehending they might lose their Sport, if

he should happen to recant, would often clap him on the Back, and cry, Sta firme Moyese (Moses, continue stedfast.)
I allow this Gentleman's Advice to have been Good, and his Observations just, and in one Respect my Condition is worse than that of the Jew, for no Recantation will save me. However it should seem by some late Proceedings, that my State is not altogether deplorable. This I can impute to nothing but the Steadiness of two impartial Grandjuries, which hath confirmed in me an Opinion I have long entertained, That, as Philosophers say, Virtue is seated in the Middle, so in another Sense, the little Virtue left in the World is chiefly to be found among the middle Rank of Mankind, who are neither allured out of her Paths by Ambition, nor Driven by Poverty.
Since the Proclamation occasioned by my last Letter, and a Due Preparation for proceeding against me in a Court of Justice, there have been two Printed Papers clandestinely spread about, whereof no Man is able to trace the Original further than by Conjecture, which with it's usual Charity lays them to my Account. The former is entitled Seasonable Advice, and appears to have been intended for Information of the Grand Jury, upon the Supposition of a Bill to be prepared against that Letter. The Other is an Extract from a Printed Book of Parliamentary Proceedings in the Year 1680 con-

taining an angry Resolution of the House of Commons in England against dissolving Grand-Jurys. As to the Former, your Lordship will find it to be the Work of a more Artful Hand than that of a Common Drapier. It hath been censured for endearouring to influence the Minds of a Jury, which ought to be wholly Free and Unbyassed, and for that Reason it is manifest that no Judge was ever known either upon or off the Bench, either by himself or his Dependents, to use the least Insinuation that might possibly affect the Passions or Interests of any one single Jury-man, much less of a whole Jury; whereof every Man must be convinced who will just give himself the Trouble to dip into the Common Printed Tryals; so as, it is amazing to think, what a Number of Upright Judges there have been in both Kingdoms for above Sixty Years past, which, considering how long they held their Offices during Pleasure, as they still do among us, I account next to a Miracle.
As to the other Paper I must confess it is a sharp Censure of an English House of Commons against dissolving Grand-Juries by any Judge before the End of the Term, Assizes, or Sessions, while Matters are under their Consideration, and not presented, is Arbitraary, Illegal, Destructive to publick Justice, a manifest Violation of his Oath, and is a means to subvert the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom.

However the Publisher seems to have been mistaken, in what he aimed at. For, whatever Dependance there may be of Ireland upon England, I hope he would not insinuate, that the Proceedings of a Lord Chief Justice in Ireland must depend upon a Resolution of an English House of Commons. Besides, That Resolution although it were levelled against a particular Lord Chief Justice, Sir William Scroggs, yet the Occasion was directly contrary: For Scroggs dissolved the Grand-Jury of London for fear they should Present, but our's in Dublin was dissolved because they would not Present, which wonderfully alters the Case. And therefore a Second Grand-Jury supplyed that Defect by making a Presentment that hath pleased the whole Kingdom. However I think it is agreed by all Partys, that both the One and the Other Jury behaved themselves in such a Manner, as ought to be remembred to their Honour, while there shall be any Regard left among us for Virtue or Publick Spirit.
I am confident your Lordship will be of my Sentiments in one Thing, that some short plain Authentick Tract might be published for the Information both of Petty and Grand-Jurys, how far their Power reacheth, and where it is limited, and that a Printed Copy of such a Treatise might be deposited in every Court, to be consulted by the Jurymen before they consider of their Verdict; By which abundance of Inconveniences would

be avoided, whereof innumerable Instances might be produced from former Times, because I will say nothing of the Present.
I have read somewhere of an Eastern King who put a Judge to Death for an iniquitous Sentence, and ordered his Hide to be stuffed into a Cushion, and placed upon the Tribunal for the Son to sit on, who was preferred to his Father's Office. I fancy such a Memorial might not have been unuseful to a Son of Sir William Scroggs, and that both he and his Successors would often wriggle in their Seats as long as the Cushion lasted; I wish the Relator had told us what Number of such Cushions there might be in that Country.
I cannot but observe to your Lordship how Nice and Dangerous a Point it is grown for a private Person to inform the People even in an Affair where the Publick Interest and Safety are so highly concerned as that of Mr Wood, and this in a Country where Loyalty is woven into the very Hearts of the People, seems a little extraordinary. Sir William Scroggs was the first who introduced that commendable Accuteness into the Courts of Judicature; But how far this Practice hath been imitated by his Successors or strained upon Occasion, is out of my Knowledge. When Pamphlets unpleasing to the Ministry were presented as Libels, he would order the offensive Paragraphs to be read before him, and said it was strange that the Judges and Lawyers of the King's Bench should be Duller than

all the People of England; And he was often so very happy in applying the Initial Letters of Names, and expounding dubions Hints (the two common Expedients among Writers of that Class for escaping the Law) that he discovered much more than ever the Authors intended, as many of them or their Printers found to their Cost. If such Methods are to be followed in examining what I have already written or may write hereafter upon the Subject of Mr. Wood, I defy any Man of fifty Times my Understanding and Caution to avoid being entrapped, unless he will be content to write what none will read, by repeating over the old Arguments and Computations, whereof the World is already grown weary. So that my Good Friend Harding lyes under this Dilemma, either to let my Learned Works hang for ever a drying upon his Lines, or venture to publish them at the Hazard of being laid by the Heels.
I need not tell your Lordship where the Difficulty lyes; It is true, the King and the Laws permit us to refuse this Coyn of Mr. Wood, but at the same Time it is equally true, that the King and the Laws permit us to receive it. Now it is most certain the Ministers in England do not suppose the Consequences of uttering that Brass among us to be so ruinous as we apprehend; because doubtless if they understood it in that Light, they are Persons of too much Honour and Justice not to use their Credit with His Majesty for saving a

most Loyal Kingdom from Destruction. But as long as it shall please those great Persons to think that Coyn will not be so very pernicious to us, we lye under the Disadvantage of being censured as Obstinate in not complying with a Royal Patent. Therefore nothing remains, but to make use of that Liberty which the King and the Laws have left us, by continuing to refuse this Coyn, and by frequent Remembrances to keep up that Spirit raised against it, which otherwise may be apt to flag, and perhaps in Time to sink altogether. For, any publick Order against receiving or uttering Mr. Wood's Half-pence is not reasonably to be expected in this Kingdom, without Directions from England, which I think no body presumes, or is so sanguine to hope.
But to confess the Truth, my Lord, I begin to grow weary of my Office as a Writer, and could heartily wish it were devolved upon my Brethren, the Makers of Songs and Ballads, who perhaps are the best qualified at present to gather up the Gleanings of this Controversy. As to my self, it hath been my Misfortune to begin and pursue it upon a wrong Foundation. For having detected the Frauds and Falshoods of this Vile Impostor Wood in every Part, I foolishly disdained to have Recourse to Whining, Lamenting, and Crying for Mercy, but rather chose to appeal to Law and Liberty and the common Rights of

Mankind, without considering the Climate I was in.
Since your last Residence in Ireland, I frequently have taken my Nag to Ride about your Grounds, where I fancy'd my self to feel an Air of Freedom breathing round me, and I am glad the Low Condition of a Tradesman did not qualify me to wait on you at your House, for then I am afraid my Writings would not have escaped severer Censures. But I have lately sold my Nag, and honestly told his greatest Fault, which was that of snuffing up the Air about Brackdenstown, where by he became such a Lover of Liberty, that I could scarce hold him in. I have likewise buried at the Bottom of a strong Chest your Lordship's Writings under a Heap of others that Treat of Liberty, and spread over a Layer or two of Hobs, Filmer, Bodin and many more Authors of that Stamp, to be readiest at Hand whenever I shall be disposed to take up a New Set of Principles in Government. In the mean time I design quietly to look to my Shop, and keep as far out of your Lordship's Influence as possible; and if you ever see any more of my Writings upon this Subject, I promise you shall find them as Innocent, as Insipid and without a Sting as what I have now offered you. But if your Lordship will please to give me an easy Lease of some Part of your Estate in Yorkshire, thither I will carry my Chest and turning it upside down, resume my Political Reading where I left it off; feed on plain

homely Fare, and Live and Dye a FREE Honest English Farmer: But not without Regret for leaving my Country-men under the Dread of the Brazen Tallons of Mr. Wood; My Most Loyal and Innocent Country-men, to whom I owe so much for their Good Opinion of Me, and of my Poor Endeavours to serve them,
I am with the greatest Respect; My Lord
From my Shop in St. Francis-Street, Dec. 14. 1724.
Your Lordship's most Obedient and most Humble Servant,"
